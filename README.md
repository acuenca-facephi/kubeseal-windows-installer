# Kubeseal Windows Installer

A simple PowerShell script that downloads the latest kubeseal CLI for Windows and adds it to the user's PATH.

To use, run `Install-Kubeseal.ps1`.

Probably you will need to change the execution policy to run the script `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.
Then you can back to default execution policy `Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`.
